This repository shows my work from the SNHU Computer Science program, demonstrating my ability to gather requirements, analyze system needs, and design effective solutions.

For the DriverPass project, I designed a system to facilitate driving lesson scheduling and management. The client needed a solution for students to register, schedule appointments, view lesson notes, and access DMV updates, as well as support administrative functions like managing packages and generating activity reports.

I excelled in gathering and analyzing requirements from stakeholders, ensuring a thorough understanding of system needs. Creating detailed UML diagrams helped visualize system interactions and workflows, making the design process efficient and clear.

If I were to revise my work, I would enhance the sequence diagram to include detailed error handling and alternative flows, providing a more comprehensive view of the system's behavior under different scenarios.

Interpreting user needs was critical. By analyzing business requirements and conducting user interviews, I translated these insights into specific system features. Considering user needs is essential for creating functional and user-friendly systems, leading to higher satisfaction and adoption rates.

My approach involves a user-centered methodology, focusing on gathering and analyzing user requirements and using UML diagrams to map system interactions. In future projects, I will continue leveraging agile methodologies to iteratively develop and refine systems, ensuring continuous alignment with user needs.
